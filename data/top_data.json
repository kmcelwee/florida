In light of r/military moving forward with holding a [full military burial with honors](https://np.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/7xylhj/even_though_hes_not_technically_military_thought/ducb91x/) for a JROTC student, I'd like to suggest that the [football coach that gave his life](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/us/football-coach-florida-school-shooting-trnd/index.html) be honored as well. Being a former high school football player myself, I realize that my coaches had more of an impact on my life than my own parents because we spent more time together than I did with my family. Coach Aaron Feis made the ultimate impact on his students lives when he decided that their lives were more important than his and they got to go home to their families. Again, I think this ultimate sacrifice should be honored. \n\nI am proposing that there be a collective effort to have Coach Aaron Feis inducted into the [Florida Sports Hall of Fame](http://flasportshof.org/about/). This may seem like a small token, but as someone who was able to witness their high school football coach be inducted into their state's sports HOF, it is a prestigious event for them and their family. This certainly isn't the most we could do for Coach Aaron Feis or his family, but I think it's a small token of appreciation that would be worth it.\n\nI'm unsure of how to move forward with this idea, so I will post the information for the main contact listed on the site, who also happens to be the President of the organization. If you share a similar sentiment,  I would ask you to send the contact an email detailing that you think Coach Aaron Feis deserves to be honored in the Florida Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nBarry Smith, President\n813-244-0328\nbarry@flasportshof.org\n\nedit: I'm not sure if this is the appropriate sub for posting this or if r/cfb, r/florida, r/HighSchoolFB, would be better, but I posted this here because I think the sub has enough readers to make an impact.\n\nedit 2: my apologizes for not including cross country Coach Scott Beigal. This was a glaring omission on my part."
